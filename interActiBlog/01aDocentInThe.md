# A Docent in the...

**I've begun what looks like** a "series" to me, of _Links Collections_ -background material for my ongoing [_A Course in Interactive Texts_](https://github.com/Interactimation/aCourseInInteractiveTexts/blob/master/courseContent.md)  
This series, called _A Docent in the-_ begins with [_in the Interarchive_](https://github.com/Interactimation/aCourseInInteractiveTexts/blob/master/aDocentInTheInterarchive.md).  
The collection in its infancy; already outgrowing it will be _A Docent in the Mediaseum_ -to come soon.
