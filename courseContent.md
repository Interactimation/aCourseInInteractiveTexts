# **A COURSE IN INERACTIVE TEXTS**

## Unit 01: _Tip, Tap, Type_

**To write interactive texts, we need to type**  
Maybe you have a "thumbs only" approach, or a hunt-and-peck of your own devising  
You will not have to be the best typist -the most accurate or the quickest- to far out-perform me  

I've been writing much of my career: in advertising and marketing, as a producer, as an educator  
-including the teaching of writing. I've walked students through everything from teleplays to Twitter campaigns  
Nevertheless I have been and remain a TERRIBLE TYPIST 

Since July of 2019, I've been learning to "touch-type" for the first time, ever, due to the [exercises at the TypingCLub](https://www.typingclub.com/)  
It's free, it's "gamified" (luvs the lil' ninja)  
-and I don't have to tell _you_ how to navigate the ads, _do I_?

### IN THE CLEAR

**We want a plain text editor**  
No formatting, no active code: "readable" characters only  

In a good text editor we can and will write a few lines of HTML, just a smidge of JavaScript and -  
**Loads and loads of Markdown**  

For purposes of this course let me urge you to [download and learn to use Atom.io](https://atom.io/)  
This "hackable text editor for the 21st century" is not like anything you've used before:  
[_It's better_](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/best-of-atom-features-plugins-acting-like-sublime-text)  
Built by and for GitHub, Atom allows you to manage entire directories of text, which it just so happens we want to do  
~ If you are already married to a plain text editor and have plenty of children... _who am I, to break up a happy family_? 

> **QUESTION:** What does HTML stand for? What do those words, like, even mean?

### MARKDOWN YER MARKUP

As mentioned, we'll be [writing a lot in Markdown](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm)  
Here, there's nothing to download, [just a sort of syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  
I originally thought I'd teach this class in HTML  
But, I mean, what a pain, right? 

Markdown is the most commonly used lightweight markup language on the internet! 

**You will learn markdown in minutes**  
**You'll explore Atom for weeks**  
**You will be "online" with your work the rest of your career**

## WRITING: _Head Cleaner_
* Follow this Tutorial to [download Atom and set it up for Markdown](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/content-strategy/atom-markdown.htm)  
In my work, I use "trailing white space" (double spaces) before hitting the `Enter` button to force "carriage returns" (new paragraphs) so I also use the Whitespace "package" - you might install that too  

* Create an Atom document on your hard drive, I call mine `headCleaner20190826-20191204` - it's in a folder called `interactiveTextsCOM375sunypoly2019` and yours might be inside something similar  
I think `100days` would be a good name  
  * **WRITE A PARAGRAPH IN IT EVERY DAY FOR 100 DAYS**  
I don't care what you write. you should try to complete a small thought  
_**You should consider that these may become public, anonymously**_ BUT you will maintain and control this document, so just write! 
  * **Format the document like this:**  
Your daily writing  
|| date, number or etc ||  
Your daily writing  
|| date, number, etc ||  
Think of whatever you put in between the || symbols as packets of metadata that follow the content
>These symbols are called "pipes"  
On English PC and Mac keyboards, the pipe is on the same key as the `backslash` key, above the `Enter` key `(Return key)` and below the `backspace` key. Pressing and holding down the `Shift` key while pressing the `pipe` key creates a pipe.

## EXERCISE / RESEARCH: _Algorithmically Derived Texts_  
**“The exquisite corpse will drink the new wine.”**
* Play -with peers- or [read about The Telephone Game](https://icebreakerideas.com/telephone-game/)
* Make -with peers- or [research the Exquisite Corpse](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-explaining-exquisite-corpse-surrealist-drawing-game-die)  
* On your own: [Create a cut-up](http://www.ubu.com/papers/burroughs_gysin.html) or a [fold-in](http://www.languageisavirus.com/creative-writing-techniques/william-s-burroughs-cut-ups.php#.XVxFNehKhjU)
* Read and Research: About [the OuLiPo](https://owlcation.com/academia/Try-Oulipo-and-No-More-Writers-Block) and [Hundred Thousand Billion Poems](https://interactiveexperience.wordpress.com/tag/a-hundred-thousand-billion-poems/#_ftn2) 
 
**Turn any these into games or exercises to create interactively created texts, narratives or poems**

## Unit 02: _Gettin all Hypertext on the Information Superhighway_

**Do you have a website? Quick, let's make one!**  
We'll be writing, displaying and sharing our [code on Glitch](https://glitch.com/)  
Glitch is free, but to sign in it will ask you for an email OR a FaceBook sign in OR a GitHub sign in 
 
Being signed into GitHub, allows you to sign into Glitch, and Glitch was made to work with GitHub 

Not coincidentally, Atom is ALSO made to work with GitHub 

If you haven't worked with GitHub previously, don't worry! Tools like Glitch and Atom (as well as the GitHub Desktop) make it easier than ever [so go ahead and create a GitHub account?](https://github.com/)  
To do this you'll STILL need an email address...  
[Gmail is free](https://gmail.com)  
If you are a minor and want to get an email account, we suggest a made-up name, for privacy  
Be sure to use a password you won't ever forget!

### Your New Website
* Click on the `New Project` button in glitch  
  * Chose the webpage option
  * In the Top Left, find the `Show` button, to the left of that, the randomly generated name of your new project  
    * Change the name of the project if you like (no Caps, no spaces - dashes are OK)
    * All Glitch project names must be unique. Glitch will warn you if a name is in use
* Click on `index.html` in the left side-bar (expand it if you don't see this)  
----
**DO YOU SEE A DOCUMENT THAT BEGINS: `<!DOCTYPE html>`?**

----
This is the code for your brand new webpage

Between `<title>` & `</title>` (about line 4) change whatever is there to the name of your new webpage  

> It can be the same as the randomly generated name Glitch picked out for your project - or the one you changed it to but now spaces and Caps are OK

### Personalize It

Between `<body>` & `</body>` you may find a line like:  
`<h1>Hi there!</h1>`  
(if not, copy and past the line, above)  
Change whatever's between the `<h1>` & `</h1>` to a HEADLINE you want on your new webpage  
Find (or copy/paste)  
`<p> I'm your cool new webpage. Made with <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>!</p>`  
Change everything between the `<p>` & `</p>` to a PARAGRAPH you want on your new webpage  
Click the "Show" button at the top, left of the page  
You may choose to view your webpage in a new window, or within the project edit page  
Copy the URL of your new page and send it to a friend! 

I started a new project called `randomly-named-webpage`  
**View it here:**  
https://randomly-named-webpage.glitch.me/  
**REMIX it here:**  
https://glitch.com/~randomly-named-webpage

> **PRO-TIP:**  
`https://your-webpage-name.glitch.me/`  
(That's right - Substitute your own project name for "your-webpage-name")  
Is the URL for your new webpage -_this is the format for sharing your project with anyone who might be confused by the remix page_    
The `<title>` you chose is the text on that page's browser tab  
The HEADLINE you wrote should be visible as well as the PARAGRAPH  

#### Congratulations on your new webpage! Copy and send the URL to anyone you like!

## WRITING: _Blog_

**Create an online Publication (the word "blog" throughout is used for convenience) - you can host it as a sort of [brutalist website](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) on Glitch (I can recommend the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) tutorial spaces) but any platform will do and most will provide tools for you  
Consider [different platforms](https://medium.com/)  
Try [different tools](https://wordpress.com)  
Experiment, but settle; what's important is creating the public facing space for your personal writing   

**These blogs exist as places to do some public, personal writing - to share research  and to establish your online presence on subjects related to our inquiries into interactive texts - YOU MAY CONSIDER THIS IS AN EXERCISE IN THE BRANDING OF YOUR OWN DEVELOPED CONTENT**  

## EXERCISE/RESEARCH: _First Blog post should come out of your research into Algorithmically Derived Texts_  

You can write an essay, compile information, make lists, organize your thoughts - but do so for public consumption  
Strive to make connections, to make things clear 
* Imagine a reader  
* Explain to them

**MORE (possible) RESEARCH: For your first blog post:**  
Fluxus "Scripts"  
Elizabot  
Lorem Ipsum  
Random Quote Generators

**You will make at least 10 blog posts over the semester**

----

> HOW TO BLOG:
* Start every writing session by creating your daily "headcleaner" paragraphs - this can be on your subject or not, you're doing this to grease the wheels, but any random thoughts on the subject you can put together will always help! 
* Present, in writing, your research
* Supply images and other media by links or embeds  
* Cite sources

**Excellence Points are available from the work you will be doing with your blog**

## Unit 03: _Mapping the Territory_

>**A map is not the territory** it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.  
— _Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity_  

### A Story As You Like It
To return for a moment to Raymond Queneau and his [Hundred Thousand Billion Poems](https://interactiveexperience.wordpress.com/tag/a-hundred-thousand-billion-poems/#_ftn2)  
If you consider the choosing of the random poem as "making 14 choices, each from 10 possibilities" you may not be surprised to learn he also wrote the first work with the form which has come to be called "choose your own adventure" - though [be careful of the trademark!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellefabio/2019/01/14/chooseco-choose-your-own-adventure-trademark-owner-sues-netflix-over-bandersnatch/#75a8a3d013b2)  

> **INDEPTH** _Trademark, Copyright, Intellectual Property_  
Questions about these will follow us throughout the course  
INDEPTHS -free-ranging discussions on topics surrounding our subject- are for classroom time. Missing classroom time means missing course material like this 

Let's look at his version, [ AStory As You Like It](http://www.zachhorton.com/mmr/files/Queneau_Raymond._A_Story_As_You_Like_It._OuLiPo--a_Primer_of_Potential_Literature._156-158.pdf?id=301219)  
Seen here also in[ _digitally_ interactive form](https://www.thing.de/projekte/7:9%23/queneau_1.html)  

>**INDEPTH** _Decision-Based Narrative_
1. Do we recognize this structure?
2. Describe other examples
3. Can we [think of any tropes](https://tvtropes.org) that express this?
* Can we think of spatial tropes that create the same kind of narrative space?
* Graphic tropes?

### WELCOME TO THE DECISION TREE
