# **A COURSE IN INERACTIVE TEXTS**

## **Unit 01: Tip, Tap, _Type_**

**To write interactive texts, we need to type**  
Maybe you have a "thumbs only" approach, or a hunt-and-peck of your own devising  
You will not have to be the best typist -the most accurate or the quickest- to far out-perform me  

I've been writing much of my career: in advertising and marketing, as a producer, as an educator  
-including the teaching of writing. I've walked students through everything from teleplays to Twitter campaigns  
Nevertheless I have been and remain a TERRIBLE TYPIST 

Since July of 2019, I've been learning to "touch-type" for the first time, ever, due to the [exercises at the TypingCLub](https://www.typingclub.com/)  
It's free, it's "gamified" (luvs the lil' ninja)  
-and I don't have to tell _you_ how to navigate the ads, _do I_?

### IN THE CLEAR

**We want a plain text editor**  
No formatting, no active code: "readable" characters only  

In a good text editor we can and will write a few lines of HTML, just a smidge of JavaScript and -  
**Loads and loads of Markdown**  

For purposes of this course let me urge you to [download and learn to use Atom.io](https://atom.io/)  
This "hackable text editor for the 21st century" is not like anything you've used before:  
[_It's better_](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/best-of-atom-features-plugins-acting-like-sublime-text)  
Built by and for GitHub, Atom allows you to manage entire directories of text, which it just so happens we want to do  
~ If you are already married to a plain text editor and have plenty of children... _who am I, to break up a happy family_? 

> **QUESTION:** What does HTML stand for? What do those words, like, even mean?

### MARKDOWN YER MARKUP

As mentioned, we'll be [writing a lot in Markdown](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm)  
Here, there's nothing to download, [just a sort of syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  
I originally thought I'd teach this class in HTML  
But, I mean, what a pain, right? 

Markdown is the most commonly used lightweight markup language on the internet! 

**You will learn markdown in minutes**  
**You'll explore Atom for weeks**  
**You will be "online" with your work the rest of your career**

#### **WRITING: _Head Cleaner_**
* Follow this Tutorial to [download Atom and set it up for Markdown](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/content-strategy/atom-markdown.htm)  
In my work, I use "trailing white space" (double spaces) before hitting the `Enter` button to force "carriage returns" - so I also use a the Whitespace "package" - you might install that too  

* Create an Atom document on your hard drive, I call mine "headCleaner20190810-20191118" - it's in a folder called interactiveTextsCOM375sunypoly2019 and yours might be inside something similar  
I think `100days` would be a good name  
  * **WRITE A PARAGRAPH IN IT EVERY DAY FOR 100 DAYS**  
I don't care what you write. you should try to complete a small thought  
_**You should consider that these may become public, anonymously**_ BUT you will maintain and control this document, so just write! 
  * **Format the document like this:**  
001  
Your daily paragraph  
002  
Your daily paragraph

#### **EXERCISE / RESEARCH:** _Algorithmically Derived Texts_  
**“The exquisite corpse will drink the new wine.”**
* Play -with peers- or [read about The Telephone Game](https://icebreakerideas.com/telephone-game/)
* Make -with peers- or [research the Exquisite Corpse](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-explaining-exquisite-corpse-surrealist-drawing-game-die)  
* On your own: [Create a cut-up](http://www.ubu.com/papers/burroughs_gysin.html) or a [fold-in](http://www.languageisavirus.com/creative-writing-techniques/william-s-burroughs-cut-ups.php#.XVxFNehKhjU)
* Read and Research: About [the OuLiPo](https://owlcation.com/academia/Try-Oulipo-and-No-More-Writers-Block) and [Hundred Thousand Billion Poems](https://interactiveexperience.wordpress.com/tag/a-hundred-thousand-billion-poems/#_ftn2) 
 

**Turn any these into games or exercises to create interactively created texts, narratives or poems**

## **Unit 02:** _Mapping the Territory_

>"A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness."  
— Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity
