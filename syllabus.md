# COM375 01 	Designing/Writing Interactive Texts:
**SUNY Polytechnic - Fall 2019**  
**8:40-10:30 M/W**  
**Don 1229**

**Lecturer: Mark Baldridge**  
**Office/Hours - DON 2143B/_TBA_**

`Preparatory Note: Throughout this course, the term "writing" is never to be interpreted as excluding images and other media`  
`The question of Rights Issues pervades the course`  
`THERE WILL BE NO CASE in which using the work of others without attribution is acceptable`  
`There may be set cases in which RIGHTS MUST BE ACQUIRED`

## THE COURSE
  
This is a writing course; you may expect to write (nearly) every day  
Time and the experience of very many writers suggest that getting used to such a regimen is a necessary hurdle  
Accordingly, we will hit this from the very beginning and not let up throughout the course  

### OBJECTIVES 
Students will explore the history and theory of Interactive Texts  
Students will create texts that interact, and interactively create texts  
Students will engage and become part of the public discussion of Interactive Texts  
Along the way, students may learn to write in a way that they have not, previously:  
_As an expansion of their academic and professional practice_  
   
**TEXTBOOK:** We will consult the online field on the subject of Interactive Texts and ourselves create a not-insignificant contribution to it  
In this way we will be _generating a textbook_ 

## SCHEDULE  

### Two types of _Writing Activities_ will continue more-or-less throughout the semester:

#### INDIVIDUAL: Owned, Branded, Competitive
* **Journaling:** All students will keep a public weekly journal or blog throughout the semester  
Can take many forms (TBD) but will be checked and commented upon weekly  
Student will read the journals of their peers and comment in their own journals, with links, notifying the owner of the linked material
  
  **The Model Here is a peculiar, competitive aspect of media:** The publication of owned journals within a market (Specialized Papers or Magazines, TV and Radio Stations in a Broadcast Area, APAs, "Scene" Zines)  
  Everything depends upon a "conversation" which is nonetheless a "competition" which may lead to some complex relations, feedback loops, mutual backscratching etc...   
  
  > **Excellence Points:** for getting more links, site visits or other criteria established in class 

#### COOPERATIVE:

* **Research/Writing:** The goal here is to establish a knowledge base
##### INTERACTEXTS (BETA)
Will be a casebook, a wiki (or wiki-like) repository of our research into interactive texts  
    **Example:** An article on "Interaction by Competition" is opened. One student may research and write a paragraph or two on how the long struggle between the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun Times shapes those papers, citing references and further reading  
    Another pair of students might dive into the question of the ownership of media, and seek examples where several "competing" outlets (newspapers, radio stations, etc) are owned by single individuals or corporation - perhaps dividing the research and writing tasks between them  
    
    **Version Tracking** will show the leaders in various categories like: Citation, Grammar, Article Starting, Writing/Editing
    
    >**Excellence Points:** for category leaders and broad generalists (categories to be established in class)  

**NOTE: Both ongoing Writing Activities** aim to develop a "community of authority" on our subject(s) in which the participation of others lends each voice credence - establishing students as stakeholders in the field  
    
### Other Assignments will be shorter-lived

** EXERCISES - RESEARCH / WRITING - Weekly (ALL STUDENTS)**
  * **Exercises:** _Write "Drunk" Edit "Sober", Cut off the Head, Any Two Points Connect_ -and other timeless maxims of the writing trade- revealed through fun, short-term exercises  
  
  * **Research/Writing** may be centered around the following fields:
      
    * **INTERACTIVE NARRATIVE - Aprox 3 Weeks** _Exquisite Corpse, OULIPO , Decision Trees, Choose Your Own Adventure_ -and other models of the Interactive Narrative   
    STUDENTS MAY CHOOSE as PROJECT  
    
    * **TOOLS FOR INTERACTIVE TEXTS - Approx 3 Weeks** _Text Editors, Git Repositories, Wiki Tools_ -and/or other tools  
    STUDENTS MAY CHOOSE as PROJECT
    
    * **SOCIAL MEDIA - Aprox 3 Weeks** _A Network is Where you Find It, Memes (Dawkins), Gaming the System_ -and other approaches to Social Media  
    STUDENTS MAY CHOOSE as PROJECT  

### Projects:
Projects can begin at any time throughout the semester  
Projects will become the focus of the last 3 weeks of the semester  
Each student will engage in either:  
* A personal Project  
* Two Group Projects 
> A single "All-Class Project" is also an option

>**Excellence Points:** Awarded at time of presentation of projects  

All Projects will probably fall within one of the Research/Writing areas, or grow out of it  
> Students may also pitch a Project

--- 

### GRADING:

Grades are based on a points system: 100 percentage points is the highest grade achievable  
Anything below a 70 will not meet the major requirements

NUM|ALPHA
---|---
100-97|A+
93-91|A-
90-87|B+
83-81|B-
80-77|C+
70-76|C 
 
I've tried to arrange the above scores to offer the most rewards for trying _just a bit harder_ - while being gentle with those who may fall behind:  
All the "plus" grades represent a 4 point range, all the "minus" grades only 3, for instance  
Letter grades begin with 1 and not 0 in the "ones place"  
I offer no C- grades
 
The 100% total breaks down like this:  
 
**30% Writing/Research/Exercises:**  
These will occur on a regular basis throughout the semester  
All students start with 100%  
Lose only by failure to accomplish  
**30% Writing Activities (INDIVIDUAL and COOPERATIVE)**  
Students can earn their "daily bread" points by participating weekly in these ongoing efforts  
**30% PROJECT:**  
Students chose Projects in TOOLS, NARRATIVE, SOCIAL (or other) fields  
These will be presented at the end of the semester  
Students may begin at any time, but individual units covering these fields will be staggered throughout the semester  
**10% Excellence Points:**
May be awarded in three ways -detailed above  

### Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, students will have:
Established themselves as interested "stake holders" in the field of Interactive Texts  
Contributed to the development of texts which interact by competition and by cooperation  
Compiled a shared "knowledge base" on Interactive Texts  
Completed an interactive, text-based project of portfolio quality   
   
>Some students will emerge with a good deal of experience in one or more aspect of production  
Others will follow a more generalized course, gaining experiences throughout the pipeline  
All will have completed tutorials emphasizing a broad skill set  

##### Attendance is Expected, Plagiarism is Punishable, Late Work will lose 30% of its value per day
