**OFFICE/HOURS**

## THE COURSE  
### This semester (Fall 2019) we'll work with a real-world client
**We will contract to produce:**  
* _Branded design Elements:_ Including 2D and 2.5D Motion Graphics:
Interstitials, transitions, backgrounds, etc  
* _Hero Character Design_: This could take a number of forms, some of them not instantly recognizable as "characters"  
* _With the stretch Goal:_ Completion of an opening credit sequence which can be used throughout the series

Our Client is John Hinton and his [Ensonglopedia Project](http://ensonglopedia.com/)  
Specifically his upcoming _Ensonglopedia of the Human_ television pilot -  
26 episodes - 12 min ea - Songs about the human body

**Client contracts to supply:**  
* _Branding Materials:_  Color Palette, Style Sheets, Font Collections, Original Art  
* _Scientific and Educational Content:_ The Pilot will be "A is for Amniotic Sac" so I imagine a lot of this will center around human gestation  
* _Song Lyrics and Music:_ These will come later and will not hold us up  
* _Timely Feedback:_ Opportunities exist for client "face time" - a rare thing for creatives to achieve

### OBJECTIVES 
Students will learn to put scientifically accurate information into visually appealing design and animation  
They will gain firsthand experience in dealing with a real-world client, working within an establish brand  
Students will work in teams, self-select for assignments based on a review of weekly tutorials, negotiate with instructor on assignment value  
Students will learn to work within a "pipeline" with upstream and downstream teammates 

**TEXTBOOK:**  
Students will compile a body of readings, tutorials and other material, - including a good deal of anatomical reference material - as a document of completion  
An ongoing process which will account for 30% of student grade  
The student finishes with a portfolio of their own creation, a personalized casebook to which they can add throughout their career
   

### SCHEDULE
Known factors: 103 days, 15 Fridays (of which we lose one to thanksgiving and I'm leery about one or two others  
-I'm looking at YOU, October 11!)  
Plus a Finals Week  
My producer's instincts tell me to:  
Divide the semester into 12 "Weeks"  
Divide the Tasks into 4 "Intensives"  
With the 4th being EXTRAS, in case we, you know, get ahead of schedule....

#### Note: Intensives will continue from their begin point to the end of the course ####
**eg: Hero Character Design begins week 4 but is unlikely to end till the project concludes**

WEEK | INTRODUCE | COMPLETE | INTENSIVE 
--- | --- | --- | ---
**01** | Illustrator; After Effects | First "Wigglemations" | Wallpapers Wipes and Wiggles  
**02** | Animating Shapes: Illustrator with After Effects| First "Wallpapers"
**03** | Animating in 2.5D: After Effects| First "Wipes" 
**04** | IN DEPTH: Translucency, Blending, Depth in 2D art | Test Sheets | Hero Character Design 
**05** | Character Design: Illustrator | Hero Design
**06** | "Puppet" Animation: After Effects | Hero Animation
**07** | IN DEPTH: Lighting, space and "mood" in After Effects | Typographic Animations | Titles Design
**08** | Timing and Easing: After Effects  | Drafts of Titles
**09** | Character and Branding issues | Titles
**10** | POSSIBLE: Infographics | Extras | Extras
**11** | POSSIBLE: Anatomical Design and Animation | Extras
**12** | POSSIBLE: Audio Stingers | Extras

~ All of this could be the highest fantasy, depending on how we work out our role with the client   
~ This syllabus is a guide we will refine as we go - ratifying our changes at each step

## GRADING

Grades are based on a points system: 100 percentage points is the highest grade achievable  
Anything below a 70 will not meet the major requirements

NUM|ALPHA
---|---
100-97|A+
93-91|A-
90-87|B+
83-81|B-
80-77|C+
70-76|C 
 
I've tried to arrange the above scores to offer the most rewards for trying _just a bit harder_ - while being gentle with those who may fall behind:  
All the "plus" grades represent a 4 point range, all the "minus" grades only 3, for instance  
Letter grades begin with 1 and not 0 in the "ones place"  
I offer no C- grades

The 100% total breaks down like this:

**30% - Reading/Tutorial Completion:** Everyone must complete all readings and tutorials  
Begin semester with full points  
Lose points only by failure to complete  
**30% - Ownership:** Includes leadership, participation, contribution in teams and in the critiques - includes:  
REPUTATION: Teammates may be periodically "polled" to score one another for this attribute
-a "real world" effect of work relationships  
**30% - Specific Assignment Grades:**
These will diverge, as students take on, or move between, specialized tasks  
The scope, even the number of assignments cannot be predicted in advance  
Accordingly each assignment will carry its own "weight" in grade value    
**10% - Excellence in Specialization/Generalization:** Not all students will participate in all assignments  
Some will "specialize" in a process or function, gaining in-depth experience, while drawing generalized knowledge from the tutorials, etc
Others will serve in a variety of  positions, gaining a generalist experience  
Some students may take on administrative, or "Producer" positions  
These "capping" 10% of points will be awarded to students for demonstrations excellence in their respective roles 

**CRITERIA: Specific Assignments**  
Assignments will be developed with students in the "Concepting" phase -establishing criteria of completion and total points value  
In the "Active" phase, critique will allow us to set the actual score  
Some projects will be sent back for further work but no further points may be gained from the assignment  
**All Assignments will be awarded points (graded)  and "Ownership" points distributed as part of the "Archive" process**  
Students should be able to calculate 90 percent of their grade at any given moment throughout the semester

By of the nature of client work, not all assignments can be detailed before the course begins  

**Assignments unfold in three phases**  
They are not competed until all these events have occurred:
* **CONCEPTING:** Develop background; Techniques (tutorials); Theory and Analysis
  * **Pitch** your design ideas
  * **Evolve** your design ideas, according to pitch feedback


* **ACTIVE:** Execute the design processes
  * **Present** your work for critique
  * **Tweak** your work according to critique


* **ARCHIVE:** Post and log your work
  * **Apply** for a new assignment
  * **Remix** your work and the work of others in the ongoing, iterative process

`AN EXAMPLE ASSIGNMENT`

> **Wigglemation:**
* Everyone traces the same object (perhaps a human heart) three times by hand, in illustrator, to size spec
* These are compiled into an animation
* Edit as (or if) needed:  
* **REMIX:** May be shuffled, randomized, reversed, recombined with other elements etc

> _Prototyped to Client, this gets us moving in an agreed upon direction
-or refocuses that course_

> ASSIGNMENT SKILLS:
Introduction to Adobe Illustrator (Blob Brush, etc)  
Designing to Brand Spec  
Introduction to Adobe After Effect  
Client interaction  
Brand refocus

> ASSIGNMENT CONCEPTS:
Remix  
Iterative, layered processes  
Rhythmic complexity

>> AND FURTHERMORE: Wiggliermation
Back to the blob brush in Illustrator
  * More complex, abstract, a pattern of blob-like brushstrokes
  * Import into After effects and animate as "swimmers"
-a background, or wallpaper`

## Learning Outcomes: On completion of this course, students will have:
An introduction and overview of:  
**Design Tools:** Illustrator, After Effects, Photoshop, etc 
**Project management and communications practices:** Kanban, Version tracking  
Client feedback and requested changes, Archiving, Process management  
**Conceptual Framework (a few examples):** Coordinate system for navigation in 3D space (After Effects)  
Layering translucencies, Blend modes, Creating volume in 2D designs (all platforms)  
Establishing mood, Creating emotion, Connecting to viewers, Ethical considerations  
Branding -working within and to expand an established brand
etc   
    
>Some students will emerge with a good deal of experience in one or more aspect of production  
Others will follow a more generalized course, gaining experiences throughout the pipeline  
All will have completed tutorials emphasizing a broad skill set  

### Attendance is Expected, Plagiarism is Punishable, Late Work will lose 30% of its value per day
