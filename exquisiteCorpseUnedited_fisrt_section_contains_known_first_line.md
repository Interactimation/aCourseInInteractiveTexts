The first night in the new house, he dreamed…


Of intruders breaking in, but also fresh apple pies. The mix of the two had him in confusion for the night, in and out of fear and comfort. He thought of his grandmother's house the morning of Christmas. He thought of fighting an unknown villain. Scenes of endless torture and temptation, dizzy with the thought of crime and pies. 


The air was cold and frosty and he woke up in panic…

The air was cold and frosty and he woke up in panic… realizing that he had had a nightmare in which he froze to death.
It was chilly in his room. He had left the window open during the storm last night. It was a wonder how he could fall asleep
in those conditions. As he got out of bed he noticed a pile of snow on the floor. He began throwing the snow back out the window.
As he picked up the snow a small item dropped out. He recognized the small item as...

He recognized the small item...

A rare item in the game he is playing. 
This Item can be used for making the characters twice stronger than it is originally.
He thought that he could use his item when he goes on a boss fight.
Of course, he has the choice to save the item and use it when he needs it, but he knows that if other
players find out he has it, they can steal it from him. 
So the best way to use a rare item is to use it before it is taken.

However, He came up with a big idea which is...

He came up with a big idea which is...

He came up with a big idea which is to make an amazing video game.
He met others of different backgrounds and styles to help make a main view of the game.
Each individual brought a new idea to the table rather it be art, music, or writing.
However, there was an issue within the team being that there was no official leader of them.
He decided to step up to the plate and takeover to help make it work out fine.
After that, he made a promise that he would do his best to keep us on track of our goal to make the best game every.

After years of hard work and dedication...

For practice I often draw with my eyes closed. It's not very effective for making good art, but it helps train your hand to draw without your brain getting in the way. Plus, learning to draw blindfolded would be a cool skill to have. But the hardest part is...

Before I could catch it, it…] lifted off the ground and floated into the field. A beacon. The field was full of them: fireflies. The night sky mirrored the ground, they were everywhere! Only...I could actually catch these stars.     [ I went inside, grabbed a net and jar and...

It flew out of the room and I followed it down the hill, right to the cliff.
I looked for a way down, but I couldn't find one. How was I supposed to catch
it now? However, it suddenly looped back around and came flying towards
me. As it flew back through the window, I chased it as fast as I can.
Before I could catch it, it...

went Jellyfishing. When I got to the field there was a bunch of people there who clearly had the same idea. I wanted some alone time but unfortunately that is not going to happen. Either way, I found a sort of quiet spot. I sat down and opened my Jar, took out my net and got to work on...

I noticed a buzzing noise coming from above my head. I looked up and saw a drone just hovering, watching me.  I watched it back and wondered who was controlling it. Why was there a drone in my house that wasn't mine? No one else was home.


It flew out of the room and I followed it down...

Tommy then decided to that his best course of action would be to gather his insurance information. He certainly did not have enough money to afford fixing a car in a condition like that! He hoped he was keeping up on his insurance payments for a day like this as he dialed the company that handled his insurance.

My height is useful when I need to fight in the arena. Every man is shorter than I! I use my advantage and my skills to be the worlds strongest gladiator! No man has faced my and survived, until now. This fight is different. My opponent although still much shorter, knows how to be quick and use my height against me. I strike at him with my club and he roles under my legs and stabs me in the back. After that, everything went downhill from there…

After years of hard work and dedication, I finally perfected my hobby of learning to draw.
I can expertly do a portrait or landscape of anything I see or visualize in my head.
It took me months of going to art class and doing daily repetition to start to feel comfortable drawing
