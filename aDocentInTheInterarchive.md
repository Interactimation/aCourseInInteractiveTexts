  * ### Raymond Queneau
One of the guiding lights of the OuLiPo, the author of  _Hundred Thousand Billion Poems_ -ten sonnets of 14 lines each, which can be read:  
> First line of 3rd poem  
Second line of 8th poem  
Third line of 1st poem...  

  And so on, in any combination -resulting in a very large number of "potential poems"
